The 'Test' subset of data was obtained by all group members by filtering out Null values in AWS Snowflake, downloading 100,000 rows. The size of this file is too large for Github, so people have included smaller subsets they have worked with. If they did not include their code, they couldn't be bothered to make the effort. Cheers, Brenden.
